 of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. He composed over six hundred [[Musical composition|works]], many acknowledged as pinnacles of [[symphony|symphonic]], [[concerto|concertante]], [[chamber music|chamber]], [[piano]], [[opera]]tic, and [[choir|choral]] [[music]]; and he is among the most enduringly popular of [[classical music|classical]] composers.

Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood in [[Salzburg]]. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty; at seventeen he was engaged as a court musician in Salzburg, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position, always composing abundantly. Visiting [[Vienna]] in 1781 he was dismissed from his Salzburg position and chose to stay in the capital, where over the rest of life he achieved fame but little financial security. The final years in Vienna yielded many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas, and the [[Mozart's Requiem|''Requiem'']]. The circumstances of his early death have been much mythologized. He was survived by his wife [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]] and two sons.

Mozart always learned voraciously from others, and developed a brilliance and maturity of style that encompassed the light and graceful along with the dark and passionate—the whole informed by a vision of humanity "redeemed through art, forgiven, and reconciled with nature and the absolute".<ref>Till, p.&nbsp;320</ref> His influence on all subsequent Western art music is profound. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] wrote his own early compositions in the shadow of Mozart, of whom [[Joseph Haydn]] wrote that "posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years".<ref>Robbins Landon, p.&nbsp;171</ref>
