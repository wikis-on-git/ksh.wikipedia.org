==Der Name der Seite==
Jrußbrittannije (Koodo)??<br />
Hi,<br />
In every other language of Wikipedia, this is a page about the country, not Koodo.<br />
Guten Tag,<br />
Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut.<br />
In allen anderen Sprachen Wikipedias, diese Seite redet vom Land, nicht Koodo.<br />
Kann der Name gewechselt werden?<br />

Hallo Varlaam, you are right. This article is of extremely low quality and I don't know why it was published. I will do my utmost to rewrite it. It will take me a few days but I am sure that it will satisfy your expectations. Regards --[[Metmaacher:BBKurt|BBKurt]] 23:33, 20. Mai 2010 (CEST)

:No problem. Thanks.
:I am sure the content is interesting to someone. But it needs a different title.
:Which city are you in? I am in Toronto.

::Hi Varlaam, I modified the article and hope that it fits to the Wikipedia standards. Unfortunately there are lots of low quality articles in the ksh-Wikipedia. Nobody took care and it is nearly impossible to change them all. I heard a lot of excuses why things can not be done but unfortunately ''nobody did anything''. Well, I hope that at least the article about the [[Jrußbritannie|United Kingdom]] is done well. By the way, I am German and live near the German city of Aachen.

:::Hi BBKurt, If you are an administrator who takes initiative, das ist ausgezeichnet. Ich habe keine Achtung vor manchen der Adminen auf englisch: nutzlos, unwissend, egozentrisch.
:::Aachen we traditionally call by the French name in English, but younger people probably only know it now as Aachen, not Aix. It's the city of Charlemagne, Karl der Große, correct? I have been to Germany 4 times, the last time in 1987. But never to Aachen. It is actually a city I want to see the next thing I am over there. But I really want to see Berlin again. On my last trip to Berlin, it was half Ostdeutschland. I like Germany; it's very friendly.
