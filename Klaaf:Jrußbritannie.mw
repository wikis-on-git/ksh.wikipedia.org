==Der Name der Seite==
Jrußbrittannije (Koodo)??<br />
Hi,<br />
In every other language of Wikipedia, this is a page about the country, not Koodo.<br />
Guten Tag,<br />
Mein Deutsch ist nicht so gut.<br />
In allen anderen Sprachen Wikipedias, diese Seite redet vom Land, nicht Koodo.<br />
Kann der Name gewechselt werden?<br />

Hallo Varlaam, you are right. This article is of extremely low quality and I don't know why it was published. I will do my utmost to rewrite it. It will take me a few days but I am sure that it will satisfy your expectations. Regards --[[Metmaacher:BBKurt|BBKurt]] 23:33, 20. Mai 2010 (CEST)

:No problem. Thanks.
:I am sure the content is interesting to someone. But it needs a different title.
:Which city are you in? I am in Toronto.

::Hi Varlaam, I modified the article and hope that it fits to the Wikipedia standards. Unfortunately there are lots of low quality articles in the ksh-Wikipedia. Nobody took care and it is nearly impossible to change them all. I heard a lot of excuses why things can not be done but unfortunately ''nobody did anything''. Well, I hope that at least the article about the [[Jrußbritannie|United Kingdom]] is done well. By the way, I am German and live near the German city of Aachen.
